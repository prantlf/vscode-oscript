    Gets or sets system character encoding.

    **Parameters**:
      encodingType: If specified, valid constants are either
                    System.NotEncoded or System.UTF8. This argument
                    should only be used at startup and only in a
                    single threaded (Builder) environment. The
                    multi-threaded server will have this set at
                    startup based on configuration ini
                    settings.

            startup and only in a single threaded (Builder)
            environment, since a cached and shared version of the
            configuration file is used in multi-threaded
            environments.

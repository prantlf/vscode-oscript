  synopsis: 'DOMText.SplitText(Integer offset): DOMText'
  comment: |-
    Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified offset, keeping
    both in the tree as siblings. This node then only contains all
    the content up to the offset point. And a new node of the same
    nodeType, which is inserted as the next sibling of this node,
    contains all the content at and after the offset point. When the
    offset is equal to the length of this node, the new node has no
    data.

    **Parameters**:
      offset: The offset at which to split the text.

    **Result**:
      The new DOMText node.

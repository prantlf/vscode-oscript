    If this attribute was explicitly given a value in the original
    document, this is true; otherwise, it is false. Note that the
    implementation is in charge of this attribute, not the user. If
    the user changes the value of the attribute (even if it ends up
    having the same value as the default value) then the specified
    flag is automatically flipped to true. To re-specify the
    attribute as the default value from the DTD, the user must
    delete the attribute. The implementation will then make a new
    attribute available with specified set to false and the default
    value (if one exists). In summary:
-
  id: GetValue
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'DOMAttr.GetValue(): String'
  comment: |-
    On retrieval, the value of the attribute is returned as a string.
    Character and general entity references are replaced with their
    values. See also the method getAttribute on the Element
    interface. On setting, this creates a Text node with the
    unparsed contents of the string. I.e. any characters that an XML
    processor would recognize as markup are instead treated as
    literal text. See also the method setAttribute on the Element
    interface.

    **Result**:
      The value of the attribute.
-
  id: SetValue
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'DOMAttr.SetValue(String data): Void'
  comment: |-
    Sets the value of the attribute.

    **Parameters**:
      data: the value of the attribute

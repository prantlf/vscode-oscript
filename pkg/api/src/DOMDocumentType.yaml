  type: Method
  synopsis: 'DOMDocumentType.GetEntities(): DOMNamedNodeMap'
  comment: |-
    A NamedNodeMap containing the general entities, both external and
    internal, declared in the DTD. Parameter entities are not
    contained. Duplicates are discarded. For example in: <!DOCTYPE
    ex SYSTEM "ex.dtd" [ <!ENTITY foo "foo"> <!ENTITY bar "bar">
    <!ENTITY bar "bar2"> <!ENTITY % baz "baz"> ]> the interface
    provides access to foo and the first declaration of bar but not
    the second declaration of bar or baz. Every node in this map
    also implements the Entity interface. The DOM Level 1 does not
    support editing entities, therefore entities cannot be altered
    in any way. Returns: A DOMNamedNodeMap of the entities.
    GetNotations DOMNamedNodeMap GetNotations() A NamedNodeMap
    containing the notations declared in the DTD. Duplicates are
    discarded. Every node in this map also implements the Notation
    interface. The DOM Level 1 does not support editing notations,
    therefore notations cannot be altered in any way.


    **Result**:
      A DOMNamedNodeMap of the notations.

  id: AssocType
  type: Property
  synopsis: 'Assoc.AssocType: Integer'
  comment: |-
    The type number for the Assoc data type.
-
  id: Copy
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.Copy(Assoc src): Assoc'
  comment: |-
    Creates and returns a shallow copy of the specified source Assoc.
    This is necessary since Assocs are passed by reference, meaning
    that simple assignment does not copy an Assoc as it does with an
    Integer. The copying process follows the same conventions used
    in function parameter passing. Thus the contents of the copy
    will contain copies of those values in the source which are
    passed by value, and and references to those values in the
    source which are passed by reference. The following example
    illustrates this:

    **Parameters**:
      src: The Assoc to copy.

    **Result**:
      The new Assoc copy.
-
  id: CreateAssoc
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.CreateAssoc([Dynamic value]): Assoc'
  comment: |-
    Returns a new, empty Assoc whose "undefined value" will be
    Undefined or value if value is specified. The "undefined value"
    is the value returned by an Assoc when referenced by a key it
    does not contain.

    **Parameters**:
      value: The "undefined value" of the returned Assoc, which will
             be Undefined if this argument is not specified.

    **Result**:
      A new, empty Assoc.
-
  id: Delete
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.Delete(Assoc a, Dynamic key): Dynamic'
  comment: |-
    Removes the specified key from the Assoc if that Assoc contains
    the key.

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc to remove a key/value pair from.
      key: The key for the key/value pair to remove.

    **Result**:
      The value removed, or the "undefined value" if the key was not
      found.
-
  id: FromRecord
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.FromRecord(Record rec): Assoc'
  comment: |-
    Creates and returns a new Assoc containing the field names and
    corresponding columns of the specified Record as its String keys
    and associated values. As with Assoc.Copy(), the new Assoc
    returned will be a shallow copy of the Record.

    **Parameters**:
      rec: The Record from which an Assoc will be created.

    **Result**:
      A new Assoc, copied from the Record.
-
  id: IsKey
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.IsKey(Assoc a, Dynamic key): Boolean'
  comment: |-
    Returns true if the specified Assoc contains the specified
    key.

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc whose key set is tested.
      key: The key to test.

    **Result**:
      True if the Assoc contains the key.
-
  id: Items
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.Items(Assoc a): List'
  comment: |-
    Returns a List of the keyed values in a.

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc whose values are returned in a List.

    **Result**:
      A List of the keyed values in the Assoc.
-
  id: Keys
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.Keys(Assoc a): List'
  comment: |-
    Returns a List of the keys in a.

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc whose keys are returned in a List.

    **Result**:
      A List of keys in the Assoc.
-
  id: Merge
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.Merge(Assoc assoc1, Assoc assoc2): Assoc'
  comment: |-
    The two Assocs are merged by copying the contents of assoc2 into
    assoc1. The copy process is the same as used for Assoc.Copy().
    If a key is common to both Assocs, then the associated value in
    assoc1 will be replaced by that in assoc2, as shown by the
    following example:

    **Parameters**:
      assoc1: Destination Assoc for merge.
      assoc2: Assoc whose contents are copied into assoc1.

    **Result**:
      A reference to the first assoc passed in.
-
  id: NotSetValue
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.NotSetValue(): NotSet'
  comment: |-
    Returns a unique data type constant useful as the "undefined
    value" for an Assoc when Undefined or other values will not work
    since they might be keys within the Assoc. Use with
    Assoc.CreateAssoc() or Assoc.UndefinedValue().
-
  id: ToRecord
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.ToRecord(Assoc a): Record'
  comment: |-
    Creates a new Record and returns it after copying the values of
    the given Assoc into it, translating String keys and values into
    field names and column entries. The Assoc should only contain
    String keys. As with Assoc.Copy(), the new Assoc returned will
    be a shallow copy of the Record.

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc to convert into a new Record.

    **Result**:
      A new Record copied from the Assoc.
-
  id: UndefinedValue
  type: Method
  synopsis: 'Assoc.UndefinedValue(Assoc a, [Dynamic value]): Dynamic'
  comment: |-
    Returns the "undefined value" for the specified Assoc. If value
    is specified than the "undefined value" for the Assoc will be
    changed to value (meaning value will be returned).

    **Parameters**:
      a: The Assoc whose "undefined value" is queried and optionally
         set.
      value: If specified, then the "undefined value" of a will be
             set to this.

    **Result**:
      The "undefined value" for the Assoc.

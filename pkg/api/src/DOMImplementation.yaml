  comment: |-
    Test if the DOM implementation implements a specific
    feature.

    **Parameters**:
      feature: The string of the feature to test (case-insensitive).
               The legal values are defined throughout this
               specification. The string must be an XML name (see
               also Compliance).
      version: This is the version number of the feature to test. In
               Level 1, this is the string "1.0". If the version is
               not specified, supporting any version of the feature
               will cause the method to return true.

    **Result**:
      True if the feature is implemented in the specified version,
      false otherwise.
